# Overview
Identify teeth in X-ray images using instance segmentation and colored labelling.
This project was originally created by 3 CS students from Boston College: Yuting Ji, Robert Smithers, and Danilla Zunic.
As the main developer, to improve the project's performance, I modified the project by using Res-Unet and achieved 90% accuracy.

<!-- ### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. It is recommended to install these within a virtual environment within the repository.

* PyTorch
  ```sh
  pip install torch
  ```


<!-- USAGE -->
## Paper and Powerpoint

Teeth Labelling is not a brand new field of study, though the amount of available data is highly limited. Teeth data is rarely open source, a product of scarcity in related machine learning research as well as protection of patients' privacy.

With this teeth segmentation utility, artifical intelligence can autonomously label teeth scans and identify malformed, missing, or otherwise important concerns relating to the count and placement of teeth. The ability to label teeth in fractions of a second serves as a vital aide to dentistry personnel.

The written paper can be found at '.pdf'; and the Powerpoint can be found at '.pptx'. I hope these will help advance research within the academic community!
